# Hi there!
I'm Christian Schlueter - a passionate Principal Developer who gets stuff done.

![Christian on Mount Baldy](christian-baldy-peak.jpg)

I have a MSc. in Distributed Systems and am based in Calgary, AB, Canada.

In my professional career I worked in several software roles including Software Developer, Custom Application Development, Project Lead, Team Lead, Technical Lead and Principal Developer - ask me for my full resume!

My job and free-time projects keep me digitally busy. In the analog world I enjoy the outdoors, climbing and exploring new cultures and countries. I speak German and English.

This is my personal list of recommendations for Calgary, the Canadian Rocky Mountains and beyond. It's a continuous work-in-progress and I'm adding (and sometimes removing) items as I discover them. I hope you enjoy, and please let me know if you came across other places I should check out!
