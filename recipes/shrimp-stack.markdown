# Spicy Shrimp Stacks with Mango Salsa
These Spicy Shrimp Stacks are a fun twist on the spicy California roll topped with fresh guacamole, bang bang sauce and homemade mango salsa.

## Ingredients
This makes about 4.

- 1 lb frozen cooked shrimp, defrosted and tails removed
- 1 inch sheet nori (seaweed (find it in grocery stores near the take to go sushi or Asian sauces aisle)
- 1 tbsp Wonton or tortilla strips for garnish
- Sesame seeds to garnish

Bang Bang sauce
- 1/2 cup light mayo
- 1 tbsp sweet chili sauce
- 2 tsp Sriracha

Quick guacamole
- 1 avocado mashed
- 1 tbsp lime juice
- 1 clove garlic minced
- 1/4 tsp salt

Mango salsa
- 1 mango diced
- 1/4 cup red pepper diced
- 1/4 cup red onion diced
- 2 tbsp cilantro chopped
- 1 tbsp lime juice
- 1/4 tsp salt

Sushi rice
- 1/2 cup dry sticky rice
- 3/4 cup water
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar
- 1 tbsp sugar

## Preparation

- Add 1/2 cup dry sticky rice and 3/4 cup water to a rice cooker or small pot on the stove and cook until the liquid is absorbed. When rice is done cooking, mix in salt, rice vinegar and sugar. Set aside to let cool at least an hour before refrigerating or using, or make up to 2 days in advance and refrigerate until you go to assemble the stacks.
- Meanwhile, mix together ingredients for guacamole (or just use mashed avocado) and mix together mango salsa, along with bang bang sauce.
- Use a 1 or 2 cup measuring cup to spoon ingredients. NOTE: I used a 2 cup measuring cup and it was the perfect size for dinner – you can use a 1 cup measuring cup to make 4 stacks that are better suited to be served as an appetizer. Spoon mango salsa into measuring cup until a there is a thin layer, then spread the avocado mixture overtop. Layer with shrimp, then strips of nori, then sticky rice.
- Press down hard, then trace with a knife all the way around the measuring cup to loosen mixture. Tap on the top of the measuring cup very hard, dumping onto a plate, careful to make sure mixture remains in tact.
- Top mango salsa with crumbled wonton or tortilla strips, then drizzle bang bang sauce overtop using a plastic bag with a tiny hole cut out in a corner. Sprinkle with sesame seeds then serve and enjoy!

## Notes

If you don’t have any spicy chili sauce, you can just use a combination of sriracha and mayo.

The actual dumping of the ingredients from the measuring cup is the hardest part of this whole recipe! It can be tough, but here are my best tips:

- Make sure to press down hard on all the ingredients to smush them together and encourage them to stay intact.
- Use a knife to loosen the outside edges of the stack while it's in the measuring cup.
- Dump the cup upside down with a plate underneath and bang the bottom of the measuring cup HARD so that the ingredients slide out.
- Worst case scenario, you can always shape the stacks after the fact with freshly washed hands.
