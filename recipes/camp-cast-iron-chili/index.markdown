# Cast Iron Campfire Chili

![Cast Iron Campfire Chili](cast-iron-chili.jpg)

This dish can be made over the camp fire. Use a cast iron pot and keep the lid on to avoid ashes from getting in.

## Ingredients
- 2 pounds ground beef
- 5 cloves garlic minced
- Salt and pepper see instructions
- 4 bay leaves
- 2 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 1.5 tsp chili powder
- 3 tbsp tamari shoyu, or soy sauce
- 1 cup water
- 1 29-oz can tomato sauce no salt added
- 2 14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes
- 2 cups elbow macaroni uncooked
- 1 cup white cheddar cheese freshly shredded (4 oz)
- Fresh thyme optional for garnish

## Preparation
1. Cook ground beef in a large dutch oven over medium-high heat for 5 minutes until mostly cooked through. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add garlic and stir every so often, 2 minutes.
2. Add bay leaves, Italian seasoning, chili powder, tamari, and 1 tablespoon salt. Stir to distribute. Add water, tomato sauce, and diced tomatoes. Put a lid on the pot and lower the heat to medium. Simmer the sauce for 15 minutes.
3. Pour 2 cups dry macaroni to the pot, stir, and return the lid and simmer for 20-25 minutes (use a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the pot and stir every so often to prevent the noodles from sticking and burning).
4. Just before serving, remove the bay leaves. Stir in the cheddar cheese. Garnish with fresh thyme.
