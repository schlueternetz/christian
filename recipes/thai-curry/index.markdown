![Thai Curry](thai-curry.jpg)

## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil or olive oil
- 1 small white onion, chopped (about 1 cup)
- Pinch of salt, more to taste
- 1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger (about a 1-inch nub of ginger)
- 2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
- 2 tablespoons Thai red/yelloq/green curry paste
- 1 1/2 can regular coconut milk (full fat)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons white or brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons lime juice
- Garnishes/sides: handful of chopped fresh basil or cilantro, optional red pepper flakes, optional sriracha or chili garlic sauce

Pick 3 to 4 of the following ingredients to add (`[red/yellow/green]` indicates which curries they work best with):
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced into thin 2-inch long strips [red/yellow/green]
- 1 yellow or orange bell pepper, sliced into thin 2-inch long strips [red/green]
- 1 cup peeled and sliced on the diagonal into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Microwave 5 minutes to soften. [red/yellow/green]
- 1 1/2 cups packed thinly sliced kale (tough ribs removed first) [red/green]
- 1 can water chestnut [red/yellow/green]
- 1 can chickpeas (rinsed) [yellow/green]
- 1 cup broccoli. Microwave 5 minutes to soften. [red/yellow/green]
- 1 cup cauliflower. Microwave 5 minutes to soften. [yellow]
- 1 small bag snap peas [red/green]

## Preparation
- To make the curry, warm a large skillet with deep sides over medium heat. Once itâ€™s hot, add the oil. Add the onion and a sprinkle of salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds, while stirring continuously.
- Then add the curry paste and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes.
- Add the coconut milk, sugar and 3-4 ingredients and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the ingredients have softened to your liking, about 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
- Remove the pot from the heat and season with soy sauce and lime juice. Add salt to taste. 
- If the curry needs a little more punch, add 1/2 teaspoon more tamari, or for more acidity, add 1/2 teaspoon more lime juice; or to reduce acidity, add a little more sugar.

Serve with rice or orzo.
