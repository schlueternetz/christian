# Hike Recommendations

## Easy
If this is your first time in the Rockies, if you go alone, have a hard time limit, or if you have limited mobility, this category is for you. Easy hiking does not mean less adventure.

## Moderate
This will get you a workout, and a serious one if you are not generally active or used to mountain hiking. The feeling of reward will kick in.

## Difficult
You must have done some mountain hiking before to do hikes in this category. Preparation is essential. Do not do these hikes alone. Difficult hikes require a lot of energy and time.

## Scrambles
Scrambles are serious hikes that require the use of hands and feet. You are almost climbing (minus the gear), and there are serious risks like terrain traps, risk of falling, rock fall, exposure, and others. If you are not sure you can handle this, don't do it - stick to hiking.

## Backcountry
These are multi-day trips that require you to bring your own camping gear, food, etc. - and you must book the backcountry campgrounds in advance.

## Winter Hikes
All of the above are mostly for the summer. You can still hike in winter, but the amount of snow, accessibility, and risks are considerable. The hikes suggested here are doable, and low risk (as low as can be) in the winter months. But they still need good preparation.
