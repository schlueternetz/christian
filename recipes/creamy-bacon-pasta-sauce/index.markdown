# Creamy Bacon Pasta Sauce

![Creamy Bacon Pasta Sauce](creamy-bacon-pasta-sauce.jpg)

## Ingredients
- 200 - 240 g dried pasta or 300 - 350g fresh pasta depending how hungry you are
- 15g butter
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 4-5 rashers streaky bacon chopped into small pieces
- 3 cups fresh vegetables chopped, eg. broccoli and zucchini.
- 3-4 garlic cloves finely chopped
- 3/4 cup cream
- 70g parmesan finely grated
- 1 tsp freshly cracked black pepper more or less depending on preference

## Preparation
1. Cook your pasta according to instructions on packet (but undercook by a minute) in a pot of well salted boiling water.
2. Heat the butter and olive oil in a frying pan (that will be big enough to fit the whole dish at the end) and fry the bacon over medium - high heat until crisp. About 4-5 minutes.
3. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving all the drippings behind.
4. Lower the heat slightly and add your vegetables, tossing to coat.
5. Add the garlic and cook for a couple of minutes.
6. Add the cream and pepper. Turn the heat down if you need, it should just be a gentle simmer here.
7. Sprinkle the parmesan over the top and let it melt into the cream.
8. Add your cooked pasta straight into the sauce with a little splash of pasta water and toss to coat.
9. Add the bacon pieces back in and give it a good toss.
10. Let it gently bubble away for a minute or two, adding more pasta water if you need to loosen.
11. Season to taste, it shouldn't really need anything as the bacon adds salt but you do you!
12. Serve with extra parmesan and enjoy!
