# Asian Sprite Chicken

![Asian Sprite Chicken](sprite-chicken.jpg)

## Ingredients
This makes about 4 servings.

- 600g of uncooked boneless chicken breast, sliced into strips
- 1 tablespoon corn starch
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 piece ginger root (tablespoon size), sliced into very thin strips
- (Optional) 1 pinch red chili flakes
- 2 cups Sprite
- 6 spring onions, chopped
- cooking oil

You can use 2 tablespoons regular soy sauce if you don't have dark soy sauce (mostly suggested for coloring).

Serve with rice.

## Preparation

Add the chicken to a ziplock bag or bowl with the regular soy sauce and a half tablespoon of the corn starch. Mix until well coated.

Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken and fry until the pieces are golden all over. Remove the chicken and set aside.

Add the ginger, garlic, chili flakes and 4 of the chopped spring onions to the pan and fry for a minute to infuse flavor.

Mix the remaining corn starch with a little cold water to make a slurry. Add the Sprite, dark soy sauce and cornstarch slurry to the pan.

Heat the sauce on medium high, add back in the chicken and let it bubble until it starts to reduce down and thicken.

Serve sprinkled with the remaining spring onions.
