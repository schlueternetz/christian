# Chicken Fajita Pasta

![Chicken Fajita Pasta](fajita-pasta.jpg)

## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 tablespoon salt 
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 pound boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 4), cut into 1/2-inch strips
- 3 medium red, green or yellow bell peppers (best: 1 each), cut into 1/4-inch strips
- 1 small yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced
- 8 ounces penne (~230g)
- 3/4 cup cream cheese, cubed
- 1/2 to 2/3 cups pepper jack cheese, shredded
- 3/4 cup crushed tortilla chips
- Optional: Sour cream or bread, for serving

## Preparation
- Combine the chili powder, cumin and salt in a small bowl. 
- Heat the oil in a large, high-sided skillet (best: large cast iron pan) over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and chili powder mixture and cook, tossing occasionally, until the chicken just starts to change color and the spices are toasted, about 2 minutes. 
- Add the peppers and onions and cook until they just begin to release some of their juices, 3 to 4 minutes.
- Add the pasta and 2 1/2 cups water to the skillet and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once it comes to a boil, continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente and the sauce is thickened and reduced by about half, 10 - 12 minutes. 
- Remove from the heat and stir in the cream cheese until melted. 
- Sprinkle the crushed chips and the pepper jack over the top. Transfer to the broiler and cook until the cheese is bubbly and starting to brown in spots, 2 to 3 minutes. 

## Notes
- If you are planning to serve a portion of the food later, skip the last step. Heat up the pasta first and then broil with freshly sprinkled toppings to keep it crispy.

- You can use a little less pasta and serve the extra-saucy dish with a fresh baguette for dipping.
