# Asparagus Galette

![Asparagus Galette](asparagus-galette.jpg)

## Ingredients
- 2 small Yukon gold potatoes, (about 8 oz), very thinly sliced
- 1/2 medium Red Onion, thinly sliced
- 8 oz. Asparagus, cut diagonally into 1-in. pieces
- 1 Tbsp. olive oil
- kosher salt
- Pepper
- 4 oz. Gruyère cheese, coarsely grated (about 1 cup)
- 1 refrigerated rolled pie crust
- 1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard
- 1 large egg

## Preparation
- Heat oven to 425 degrees F. In a large bowl, toss together the potatoes, onion, asparagus, olive oil, and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Add the Gruyère and toss to combine.
- Working on a piece of parchment paper, roll the pie crust into a 12-inch circle. Slide the paper (and crust) onto a baking sheet. Spread the mustard on the pie crust, leaving a 3-inch border around the edge.
- Spoon the potato-asparagus mixture onto the pie crust, leaving a 2 1/2-inch border around the edge. Fold the border over the mixture.
- In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and 1 tablespoon water. Brush the crust with the egg mixture and bake until the crust is golden brown and the vegetables are tender, 30 to 35 minutes (cover with foil if the crust is browning too quickly). Transfer to a cutting board and cut into pieces. 

Serve with a salad, if desired.
