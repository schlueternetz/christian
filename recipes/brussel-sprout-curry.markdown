# Sauteed Brussel Sprouts

![Brussel Sprout Curry](brussel-sprout-curry.jpg)

## Ingredients
This makes about 4-6 servings.

Serve with Naan bread or Orzo.

- 11oz Brussel Sprouts
- 2/3 cup raw unsalted cashews
- 1/2 cup canola oil
- 1 tsp black mustard seeds
- 3/4 tsp asafoetida (or 1/2 tsp each onion and garlic powder)
- 1 tbsp cumin seeds (or 1.5 tsp cumin powder)
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 2 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp ground cayenne pepper
- 1 cup finely chopped tomatoes
- 3/4 container cottage cheese (or 1lb paneer in 1/2 inch cubes)
- 1 large red bell pepper in 1/2 inch cubes

Optional:
- 1 chicken breast cut in small pieces
- 3/4 cup chopped cilantro

## Preparation

Since you will use high heat, the seeds will cook very quickly in oil. Therefore, have all your ingredients ready to add to the spices immediately.

Cut the stalks off Brussel sprouts and peel off any outer leaves that are tough or damaged. Discard these. Wash Brussel sprouts and cut each one in quarters, lengthwise. Some leaves will fall off, but be sure to keep them for cooking. Add chopped red pepper and tomatoes into the bowl.

If you add chicken, brown it with salt and pepper in a separate pan, then set aside.

Preheat the oven or toaster oven to 375 deg F. Spread cashews on a baking tray and bake for 3 minutes. Gently stir cashes to roast them evenly. Return to the oven for another 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Watch carefully because cashwes can burn quickly. Remove from oven and let them cool. Then break them into pieces and set aside.

Put asafoetida (or onion/garlic powders), cumin (powder), turmeric, salt and cayenne pepper into a small bowl. Have the cooked chicken and cheese ready to go, once you start cooking, it will be ready very quickly. 

If you use Orzo as a side dish, boil the water and start with the next step immediately after you add the Orzo to the water - both should be ready at about the same time.

In a large shallow pan, heat oil and mustard seeds for 1 minute on medium-high heat. Once it starts sizzling, add the spices and stir for 1 minute. Be careful not to burn the seeds. (If it is about to burn before the 1 minute is up, turn off the heat and quickly add tomatoes and Brussel sprouts. Then return the heat to medium.)

Add vegetables and stir well. Cover and cook vegetables for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in cheese and cook for another 2 minutes:

- Paneer: uncovered. Cook until vegetables are cooked but not mushy.
- Cottage cheese: covered until the cheese starts to melt, then 1 minute uncovered.

Just before serving, add the chicken and mix. Serve in a bowl on a bed of Orzo or with warmed naan bread on the side. Garnish with cilantro and cashew pieces.

## Notes
- Use coconut milk instead of cheese and skip the chicken to make this dish vegan.
- This is a good recipe for batch cooking - it freezes well. Make fresh Naan or Orzo each time.
