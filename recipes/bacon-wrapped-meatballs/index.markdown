# Bacon-Wrapped Meatballs

![Bacon-Wrapped Meatballs](bacon-wrapped-meatballs.jpg)

## Ingredients
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 1/4 cup plain panko breadcrumbs
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 6 slices thick-cut bacon
- 2 tablespoons bbq sauce (or to change it up, tamarind sauce)
- fresh chopped parsley, for garnish (optional)

## Preparation
1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
2. Place the onion powder, garlic powder, egg, breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper into a medium-sized bowl and stir together until combined.
3. Add the ground beef and mix well. Roll meatball mix into 12 even-sized balls, a little over 2 tablespoons each, set aside.
4. Slice the bacon in half down the middle, then slice it again in half length-wise. Using a toothpick, secure two slices of the cut bacon around each meatball in a criss-cross pattern. Repeat with all of the meatballs.
5. Place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 40-45 minutes until the bacon is crispy.
6. While the meatballs are baking, mix together the bbq sauce and grape jelly in a small bowl.
7. When the bacon is crispy, brush the meatballs with the sauce. Place them back in the oven for 5-10 minutes until glazed and caramelized.
8. Serve with a garnish of parsley, optional.
