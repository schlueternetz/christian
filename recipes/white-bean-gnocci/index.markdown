# White Bean & Sun-Dried Tomato Gnocci

![White Bean & Sun-Dried Tomato Gnocci](white-bean-gnocci.jpg)

## Ingredients
- half cup sliced oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes plus 2 tablespoons oil from the jar, divided
- 1 (16 ounce) package shelf-stable gnocchi
- 1 (15 ounce) can low-sodium cannellini beans, rinsed
- 1 (5 ounce) package baby spinach
- 1 large shallot, minced
- one-third cup low-sodium no-chicken broth or chicken broth
- one-third cup heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- one-quarter teaspoon salt
- one-quarter teaspoon ground pepper
- 3 tablespoons fresh basil leaves

## Preparation
1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add gnocchi and cook, stirring often, until plumped and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add beans and spinach and cook until the spinach is wilted, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate.

2. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan and heat over medium heat. Add sun-dried tomatoes and shallot; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Increase heat to high and add broth. Cook until the liquid has mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes.

3. Reduce heat to medium and stir in cream, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Return the gnocchi mixture to the pan and stir to coat with the sauce. Serve topped with basil.
