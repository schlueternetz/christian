## Ingredients
- Multicolor baby potatoes.
- 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
- Garlic powder
- Italian seasoning
- Salt and Pepper

## Preparation
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F and set a rack in the center of the oven. Cut the potatoes in half.
2. Season the Potatoes: Evenly cover the bottom of the sheet pan with oil, and sprinkle the oil with garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.
3. Place the potatoes cut-side down over the seasoned oil. Spritz the tops of the potatoes with olive spray and season with more salt.
4. Bake the potatoes for 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes, until the bottoms are golden, and they’re fork tender when pierced with a knife.
